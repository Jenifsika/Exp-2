# Exp - 2 LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:
To draw a UML diagram for a library management system
# SRS (Procedure):
# Actors Used-:

1.Librarian

2.Student

3.Staff

4.Admin

# Software - StarUML

# List of Diagrams -:

1.Class Diagram

2.Usecase Diagram

3.Package Diagram

4.Activity Diagram

5.Communication Diagram

6.Sequence Diagram

# Procedure-:

1.Define System Requirements: Outline the functional and non-functional requirements, such as user authentication and transaction processing.

2.Identify Key Actors and Use Cases: Determine actors and define their interactions.

3.Design the System Architecture: Break down the system into components

4.Create UML Diagrams: Develop use case, class, sequence, and activity diagrams based on the system design.

5.Test and Validate: Perform testing to ensure the system meets functional requirements and security standards.
